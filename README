This project is a backpanel for the subrack we use at EPL (Eaton Peabody Lab). These racks have been in use in the lab since the 1960's but the backpanels were always very laborious contructions. This project makes them into something you can put together in a day or two. 

I know the pricetag looks killer but keep in mind this saves a fortune because the modules (except for the front panels) are reusable. We tend to spend a lot of time repurposing hardware. This makes that process a lot easier, faster and cheeper. The bad way is to continue to buy boxes and then machine them for each device. This is a huge pain in the neck and since most of them get used once or twice it is just a waste.
